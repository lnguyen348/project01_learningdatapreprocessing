    "Real number data types were changed to integer types for a cleaner look to the values. Additionally, missing values were noticed in the variables 'days_employed' and 'total_income' which were replaced with each respective column's median value to reduce a significant effect on the median and mean values (in contrast if the missing values were replaced with 0). Negative values for 'days_employed' were changed to 0. Furthermore, the variables 'family_status', 'purpose', 'total_income', and 'children' were simplified further and put into categories for better organization and data presentation.\n",

    "In terms of influence on repaying a loan on time, the relationship between having children and the aforementioned, according to the data, is that the more children a family has the more likely an applicant will repay a loan on time. In the same fashion, applicants who are married or unmarried are less likely to repay a loan on time as compared to applicants who are divorced or widowed. The data also showed that applicants that have a total income between $10,001−$30,000 are less likely to repay a loan on time, and those making between $30,001-$50,000 are also not likely to repay a loan on time, however not as much as the aforementioned applicants—the applicants that have a higher possibility of repaying a loan on time have a total income of up to $10,000. Of the borrowers who apply for a particular type of loan in the order of most likely to least likely to repay a loan in a timely manner are: wedding, housing, education, car, real estate."

Additionally, missing values in days_employed could mean choice of nondisclosure or they are unemployed. These actual reason could also be deduced from the applicant's income_type. If I were to replace the NaN values with 0, that would significantly affect the average and median values for 'days_employed' and 'total_income'. I elect to replace the NaN values with each respective column's median value because in each case the median is less than the average which implies that high extreme values are pulling the mean up."
